freud said,love and work.work and love.that's all there is. 

As u can imagine,that is given me some time on my hands.

That is an ongoing,relentless effort in creativity.

At first,i admit i enjoyed the novelty of it.sort of felt like i was playing hooky.i used all the 
miles i'd saved and traveled the globe.the problem was,no matter where i went,as soon as i got 
home,the nowhere-to-be thing hit me like a ton of bricks,i realized the key to this whole deal was
to keep moving.get up,get out of the house,and go somewhere,anywhere.

come rain or shine,i'm at Starbucks by 7:15.can't explain it,but it makes me feel part of 
something,how do i spend rest of day?u name it...

the only traveling i do these days,is out to San Diego to visit my son and his family,they're 
great.i love them to pieces,but to be honest,i think i probably relied on them way more than i 
should.

don't get me wrong,i'm not an unhappy person,quite the contrary.i just know there's a hole in my 
life,and i need to fill it.SOON.
