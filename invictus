invictus

quote William Ernest Henley (1849-1903)
out of the night that covers me
black as a pit from pole to pole
i thank whatever gods may be
for my unconquerable soul

Q:how do i cope with trying and failing?
A: 1)i failed numbers of times in my life.
      build chronology:
      i saw a good friendship fail before me.
      i failed to get into the college of my choice .
      i was drenched in shame and regret in my first two years in college.
      i failed to identify people who i should not have trusted deeply.
      i failed to pick up the guitar to play.
 
      until today ,i still donnot know how to live with the tired that ieveitably creeps 
      into every relationship.

   
   2) these things which were after effort, and some were  due to lazy indifference,and 
      others where i could not value what i was expected to achieve.

   3)so Q: Is it my ultimate goal?
            Am i realize what i truly wanted in life?
            How can i have self-esteem if i don't think my values are worth seeking || that
            i am unable to attain them?
