Q:scared of failure?

A:
all the ths in life and life itself is transient.we need to try ths that want to do now.

it's kinda a now or never situation everyday we face.it's a man's duty to make every effort towards achieving goal and 
success.if we don't try it will leave us with regrets only and noth else.

there is one big diff between the real life and our learning process in schools.in schools,first u r given the lesson and
then the test.but in real life,first u r given a test and then a lesson.

every mistake or failure that we go through,in fact,carriers with it a life lesson that we should learn,grieving,worrying
about too much and falling into depression will not take u any further but only cuz u mental and emotional trauma.

real life as no one can deny is full of ups and downs.there will be good times along with bad times.strive to do the very
best of ur efforts and however the result comes.despite ur full effort spent on it,try to find a lesson on it,appraise
the process and try to aviod it in the future works.

--aren't u worried?
--would it help?

Q:how can i stop worring and start living?
A:if u stop worring,would u really start living ?
  if not.u r searching for life so desperately,that onece a problem is over,u will find sth else bothering u,and after that
  sth else.

  the reality is ,our life is what controls us.walking through the path of life we get polished,and eventually we shine.

  life keeps on.u want to live,start today.care about the ths that matter to u and ur loved ones.and it is alright to get a
  bit worried about it sometimes.it is life,it happens.but if u think this caring and worring will end one day that day u will
  live.that day is never going to come.

  just figure out whether the ths u r worried about r worth that time and mood of urs.

  stop chasing life.it will come to u.
