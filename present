ery many of us suffer from a peculiar sounding problem:an inability properly to inhabit the
stretch of time we call the present.

it's somewhere at work or in imaginary discussion with a rival or plotting a new enterprise.
our body is rooted in the now,but our minds are skippingg to points in both the future and
in the past.

one benefit of the past is that it is a dramatically foreshortened edited version of the
present.even the best days of our lives contain a range of dull and uncomfortable moments.
but in memory,like skilled editors of hours of raw and often uninspired footage,we can lock
on to the most consequential moments;

and therefore construct sequences that feel a great deal more meaningful and interesting
than the settings that generated them.hours of mediocrity can be reduced to five or six perfect 
images.nostalgia is the present enhanced bt an editing machine.

much of what ruins the present is sheer anxiety.the present always contains an enormous number
of possibilities.some hugely gruesome,which we are constantly aware of in the background.

the simple dread at the unknownness of what is to come.but them,of course,only a very limited 
range of awful things do ever come to pass.and we forgrt the anxiety at once.or rather shift
it to the new present.

we need to be prepared for thr weird way in which we aligh with the world.and not berate 
ourselves unduly for our difficulties at doing justice to where our bodies and minds happen
to be.

we should be ready for this disloyalty in other people too.at moments when they look strangely
worried at a party we've laid on or don't seem to be listening to a story we are telling them.
they too may just be experiencing some of the major difficulties of being in the present.
