the idea that we have gods,we search for meaning,and we think of that as the highest thought we can have,who made
 me and i'm gonna make other things

--what about the reality we left behind?
--what about the reality where Hitler cured  cancer?the answer is don't think about it.


Q:nothing means anything?
A:the knowledge that nothing matters,while accurate,gets u nowhere,the planet is dying,the sun is exploding,the 
  universe is cooling ,nothing's gonna matter,the further back u pull,the more that truth will endure.
  But when u zoom in on earth,when u zoom into a family,when u zoom into a hunman brain and a childhood and an
  expericence,u see all these things that matter,we have this feeling chance to participate in an illusion,called 
  i love my girlfriend,i love my dog,how is that not better?
  
  knowing the truth which is that nothing matters can actually save u in those moments,nobody exists on purpose,
  nobody belongs anywhere,everybody's gonna die,onece u get through that terrifying factual and accepting that,then
  every place is the center of the universe,and every moment is the most important moment,and everything is the 
  meaning of life.
