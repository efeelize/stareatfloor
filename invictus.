invictus


quote:
(from az quotes)
By William Ernest Henley (1849-1903)

out of the night that covers me
black as a pit from pole to pole
i thank whatever gods may be
for my unconquerable soul

in the fell clutch of circumstance
i have not winced nor cried aloud
under the bludgeonings of chance
my head is bloody,but unbowed

it matters not how strait the gate
how charged with punishments the scroll
i am the master of my fate
i am the captain of my soul


  what i need now is either a newer tomorrow of a better way to achieve 
  the same one.maybe i should move from the 1080p to the 360p version of
  tomorrow at this stage,or may i should be bold enough to accept the
  fact that i did not try enough and audacious enough to think that i can
  do better.(ie,be the stubborn child who just would not stop crying 
  till i get that freaking toy.)

   so i sit down and ls -al:


Q:how do i cope with trying and failing?

A:
 
 1)i failed numbers of times in my life.

 build chronology:
 
 i saw a good friendship fail before me.
 i failed to get into the college of my choice .
 i was drenched in shame and regret in my first two years
  in college.
 i failed to identify people who i should not have trusted deeply.
 i failed to pick up the guitar to play.
 until today ,i still donnot know how to live with the
  tired that ieveitably creeps into every relationship.

 2) these things which were after effort, and some were 
 due to lazy
indifference,and others where i could not value what i 
was expected to
achieve.


 3)so 

Qs:
   Is it my ultimate goal?
   Am i realize what i truly wanted in life?
   How can i have self-esteem if i don't think my values are worth seeking, 
   or that i am unable to attain them?

A:  
  haha,now i know the answer is yes.
  funny thing is my daddy ask me exactly the same Qs i ls above.

  And my daddy said:
  welocme to the real world,u r not the only one who has had to go through 
such hell.yes it is fell like right now,but it never means that u cannot do
it.years later u will back at this time thinking howit seemed like so big an
issue then but it actually is not.it is ok,and failling is a part of life.
  
  then he asked me find out what go wrong and figure out what need to do.
  he said: it is okay to walk away before everything get any worse and go do 
  sth else while u get refoused.(i will think about it but not now.)


  Q:What am i gonna do?

  A:

  1)Keep Buggering On.I am only flesh and a little bone.

  2)ignore who never got better marks but all of a sudden passed the exam.
  just say FU in my mind and smile,laugh and move on.

  3)Dad suggest me 2 get along with my co-workers.Do i need 2 listen them 
  talking rubbish in the office? definetly not,cuz most of time they just 
  chatting.is it more impor than excel at ur work? no, i always inclined that
  bosses want productivity first and if u get along that is a bonus for them.
  i know many co. fired sb and then they say "fit in to our culture",they
   primarily mean,how attractive do u look and how well u get along with 
   others.not so much on job ability.It is a sick world we live in and yet we
   wish 4 world peace? we cannot even fix our own behaviors.(okay,i have gone completely
 off-track.)

  4) sometimes i postpone ths cuz i wanna achieve perfection-in making
   notes,in weiting answers,in understanding concepts or in acquiring 
   materials.

     i decide to ask myself following Qs when i do this:

     can i complete this task today?
     why am i feeling like postpoing it?
     is the resaon i am giving myself logical and valid?
     will i really utilize today's time to the best possible way if i 
     postpone this task?


  5）i really should not look at the decision as all-or-nothing;if anything, 
  should i doing both？
     or should i keep the th simple? foucus one th is easier way,it helps 
     focus better,make me prioritize learning goals,and streamlines work so 
     i don not feel overwhemlmed with having 2 accomplish 2 many ths in a 
     single day.

     sometimes it feel like distractions,cuz my attention move 2 little th
     i notice around us.i always easily make me slip from
