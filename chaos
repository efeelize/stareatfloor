--we're back to that?r we back there?what about the past couple of days?they happened,u know?
--i know that they happened.and they r wonderful,but they were also very irresponsible.i have a fiance waiting
  for me at a hotel.who's going to be crushed when he finds out.
--so u make love to me and then u go back to ur husband?was that ur plan?was that a test that i didn't pass?
--no ,i made a promise to a man. he gave me a ring and i gave him my word.
--and ur word is shot to hell now.don't u think?
--i don't ...i don't know.i'll find out when i talk to him.
--this is not about keeping ur promise.and it's not about following ur heart.it's about security 


--don't u take the easy way out.
--what easy way?there's no easy way.no matter what i do,somebody gets hurt.
--would u please stop thinking about what everone wants.stop thinking about what i want,what he wants,and what ur
  parents want.what do u want?
--it's not that simple.
