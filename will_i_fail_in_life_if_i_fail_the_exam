will_i_fail_in_life_if_i_fail_the_exam

quote by Thomas A. Edison

Tomorrow is my Exam. But I don't care because a single sheet of Paper can't decide my future.

I have not failed. I’ve just found 1,000 ways that won’t work.



Q:why i get tense & depression?
  Am i the ultimate reason behind all the happenings of my life ?

A: 
  howsoever much i may try to tell myself that failures are the pillars to 
  success and that failing is okay, the thing about failure is ,it hurts.it
  is freaking hurts to fail.
  
  all those hours of preparation, those missed hangouts and longer than
  intended breaks haunt me.but what hurts even more is that,the tomorrow i 
  imagined was certain never going to come now.

  i know the beautiful adorned the door of our classroom in school:
   it is better to try and fail than not to have tried at all.
   whenever u fail,pick sth up.
  

  and others told me:
   1)the real failure is to lost the hope and quit. The thing which naming
    'failure ' is ultimately 'the plans that didn't work ' 
    don't take failure emotionally its okay to fail again and again but
     what not okay is to 'quit'.

   2)set your mind like a champion and start a diary and note down the 
   points which are responsible behind the bad performance and then at the
   moment start to work for improvement. 


   3)Its your thinking that limits the infinite power of your brain. 
   person who failed lot is supposed to be motivator (as its he only who
  learned lot ) not the motivation seeker'. 

   4)Do no focus on a plan, but on the goal. On the road u may get tired,
  but if you remember what you're fighting for, you get on your tracks. 


   okay,i will delete those words in future...

  what i need now is either a newer tomorrow of a better way to achieve 
  the same one.maybe i should move from the 1080p to the 360p version of
  tomorrow at this stage,or may i should be bold enough to accept the
  fact that i did not try enough and audacious enough to think that i can
  do better.(ie,be the stubborn child who just would not stop crying till
  i get that freaking toy.)

   so i sit down and ls -al:


Q:how do i cope with trying and failing?

A:
 
 1)i failed numbers of times in my life.

 build chronology:
 
 i saw a good friendship fail before me.
 i failed to get into the college of my choice .
 i was drenched in shame and regret in my first two years in college.
 i failed to identify people who i should not have trusted deeply.
 i failed to pick up the guitar to play.
 until today ,i still donnot know how to live with the tired that ieveitably creeps into every relationship.

 etc...(i cannot bear to do this today)

 2) these things which were after effort, and some were due to lazy
indifference,and others where i could not value what i was expected to
achieve.


 3)so 

   is it my ultimate goal?
   am i realize what i truly wanted in life?
   how can i have self-esteem if i don't think my values are worth seeking, or that i am unable to attain them?
