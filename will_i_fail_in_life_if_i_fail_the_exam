will_i_fail_in_life_if_i_fail_the_exam

quote by Thomas A. Edison

Tomorrow is my Exam. But I don't care because a single sheet of Paper can't decide my future.

I have not failed. I’ve just found 1,000 ways that won’t work.



Q:why i get tense & depression?
  Am i the ultimate reason behind all the happenings of my life ?

A: 
  howsoever much i may try to tell myself that failures are the pillars to success and that failing is okay, the thing about failure is ,it hurts.it is freaking hurts to fail.
  
  all those hours of preparation, those missed hangouts and longer than intended breaks haunt me.but what hurts even more is that,the tomorrow i imagined was certain never going to come now.

  i know the beautiful adorned the door of our classroom in school:
   it is better to try and fail than not to have tried at all.
   whenever u fail,pick sth up.
  

  and others told me:
   1)the real failure is to lost the hope and quit. The thing which naming 'failure ' is ultimately 'the plans that didn't work ' 
    
    don't take failure emotionally its okay to fail again and again but what not okay is to 'quit'.

   2)it's the basic motive behind failure they are just symbol for the requirement of a new updated version of the current version. 

   3)set your mind like a champion and start a diary and note down the 
   points which are responsible behind the bad performance and then at the
   moment start to work for improvement. 


   4)Its your thinking that limits the infinite power of your brain. 
   person who failed lot is supposed to be motivator (as its he only who learned lot ) not the motivation seeker'. 

   5)Do no focus on a plan, but on the goal. On the road u may get tired, but if you remember what you're fighting for, you get on your tracks. If you fail an exam, a person, a requirment, a wish, whatsoever, you do not fail your life. It's not like you knew what's going to happen in your life, you do it, you're the one living it, you're the leader of life in you; and if you failed a freakin' exam and feel like you failed to yourself, like you're nothing but an ashamed cry-baby, or a suicidal person, it's your choosing.


   okay,i will delete those in future...

   what i need now is either a newer tomorrow of a better way to achieve the same one.maybe i should move from the 1080p to the 360p version of tomorrow at this stage,or may i should be bold enough to accept the fact that i did not try enough and audacious enough to think that i can do better.ie,be the stubborn child who just would not stop crying till i get that freaking toy?

   so i sit down and ls -al:


Q:how do cope with trying and failing?

A:
 
 1)i failed numbers of times in my life.

 build chronology:
 
 i saw a good friendship fail before me.
 i failed to get into the college of my choice .
 i was drenched in shame and regret in my first two years in college.
 i failed to identify people who i should not have trusted deeply.
 i failed to pick up the guitar to play.
 until today ,i still donnot know how to live with the tired that ieveitably creeps into every relationship.

 etc...(i cannot bear to do this today)

 2) these things which were after effort, and some were due to lazy indifference,and others where i could not value what i was expected to achieve.


 3)so is it my ultimate goal?
   am i realize what i truly wanted in life?
   all life requires striving to achieve values, so not only is it good practice to try, it is essential to success and self-esteem (how can you have self-esteem if you don't think your values are worth seeking, or that you are unable to attain them?)

   
Q: what it is effects how i learn and what strategies i would need?
